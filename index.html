            Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio site. I am currently working towards a certificate in
            Full Stack Development while also working as an Interactive Designer.
            I received my education in Graphic Design from Pratt Institute and Emmanuel College and have worked as a
            designer for the past 10 years. I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity
            to work with exciting clients and within teams leading the creative direction on numerous initiatives and
            campaigns. I've always enjoyed expressing myself creatively and I feel lucky to
            be able to do that everyday in my career. Over the past few years i've been exploring user experience and
            web development and have worked towards building out those skillsets for my own
            professional development and interest. </p>
